# CNN-for-Leaf-Wilting-Detection-in-Soybean-Crops
Detect amount of wilting in leaves using CNN

Project done for ECE 542 Deep learning course.

* Transfer learning (vgg-19) with data augmentation techniques for multi-classification of soybean crop images
* Semi-supervised Learning using unlabeled images based on ladder network where both supervised and unsupervised (autoencoder) parts are trained simultaneously to minimize the loss
